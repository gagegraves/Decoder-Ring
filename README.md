# Decoder-Ring

A project for my thinkful bootcamp that I wrote the javascript for. Takes strings as inputs and encodes/decodes them using ddifferent encryption methods.

Reasearch for this project was done through the thinkful bootcamp, and this helped solidify my basic JavaScript skills that I use to this day.

This project is able to encode and decode any text you enter. It uses 3 different methods for encryptions, and you can choose the method you'd like.

Created using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS that I was learning while putting this project together.
